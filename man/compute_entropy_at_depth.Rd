\title{Compute normalized entropy of a given cell state at a specific depth}
\usage{
compute_entropy_at_depth(
  tree,
  leaf_states,
  state_label,
  node_depth_df,
  depth_level
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree of class \code{"phylo"}.}

\item{leaf_states}{A named vector mapping tip labels to state labels.}

\item{state_label}{A single value indicating which state to compute entropy for.}

\item{node_depth_df}{A data.frame as returned by \code{compute_node_depths()}.}

\item{depth_level}{An integer depth at which to compute entropy.}
}
\value{
A numeric between 0 and 1 giving the normalized Shannon entropy
of counts of the given state among descendants at that depth, or \code{NA}
if there are no nodes or no counts.
}
