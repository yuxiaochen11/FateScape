Description: LineageCast groups cells belonging to the same state lineage into a
    single group. It reconstructs sub-cell-division trees separately through an
    iterative process. In the loop, LineageCast first employs Wardâ€™s
    method to construct an initial tree by clustering observed cells exhibiting
    similar lineage barcodes instead of generating an initial tree randomly.
    Secondly, LineageCast infers lineage barcodes and cell states of internal cells
    based on that of observed leaf nodes. Thirdly, LineageCast calculates the
    combined likelihood of the sub-cell-division tree that integrates both mutation
    and expression data. Fourthly, LineageCast swaps two subtrees sampled according 
    to a specific probability distribution to update the candidate sub-cell-division tree.
    Given that LineageCast is a heuristic algorithm without a globally optimal solution, 
    it iteratively executes the processes of ancestor inference, combined likelihood 
    calculation, and subtree swapping to refine the candidate tree until the
    convergence is achieved. Once all sub-cell division trees are obtained, 
    LineageCast should drop duplicate cells among all sub-cell-division trees. 
    For those sub-cell division trees, LineageCast prunes and rearranges subtrees 
    rooted at internal nodes based on lineage barcode similarity of them.
